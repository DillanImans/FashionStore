### Personal Importance
I made this to practice up my Java abit. I only had about a week to make this for my Java final project
in my university (alongside other exams that I needed to study), and so this is what I made. I definitely know
that I could've made it better with less code duplication, better folder structure, and images, but that's okay for now.
I hope I can make better projects in the future! (love you Prof. Tamer)

### Note
Run the .jar file to run the project.
